# CuttingEEG's Carbon Footprint Analysis

This project aims to analyze the carbon footprint of participants traveling to the CuttingEEG conferences. The repo includes responses of post-conference carbon footprint surveys, scripts for data visualization, and html reports of the carbon emissions associated with different modes of transportation used by the participants to recent CuttingEEG conferences.

## R Markdown Files

### Cutting2021_carbonfootprint.Rmd
This file processes the survey data from the 2021 CuttingEEG conference, calculates the carbon emissions for each participant based on their travel information, and generates visualizations to represent the data. The final output is an HTML report summarizing the carbon footprint of the conference.

### Gardens2023_carbonfootprint.Rmd
Similar to the 2021 analysis, this file processes the survey data from the 2023 Cutting Gardens conference. It calculates the carbon emissions for each participant, generates visualizations, and produces an HTML report summarizing the carbon footprint of the conference.
